# New Project Initiative - LOBBY FRONT END ENHANCEMENTS

---

## Current Situation
Currently, only **8% of user sessions in Excite sites** engage with the Search functionality.  
By contrast, **56% of Vera & John players** use Search to find a game to play.

---

## Opportunity
By improving the search experience, we will optimize the customer journey and alleviate content discovery.  
If the players find the Search experience useful, we can utilize its space as an additional content area in the product.

---

## High Level Scope
- Index gamemeta to allow players to search by provider and other data and provide ability to filter by metadata also.  
- Improve search performance, retain and display the search history for each player.  
- Turn Search into an exploration space to encourage players to find games that they may not interact with otherwise.  
- Add fuzzy logic to improve search results and provide relevant suggestions for the search that yields no results.
