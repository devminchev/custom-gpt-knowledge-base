# Contentful → OpenSearch Schema Guide (Canonical Stub)

This document is the canonical cross-project entry point for schema guidance that spans
Contentful models and OpenSearch indexing. Until a shared schema file is centralized here,
use the following canonical project sources:

- **Advanced Search integration details:** `projects/advanced-search/current/contentful-opensearch-integration-guide.md`
- **Contentful modeling principles:** `contentful-models/01-cms-modeling-principles-core.md`
- **Search architecture flow context:** `projects/advanced-search/current/current-search-overview-analysis.md`

When a unified schema is extracted from project-specific docs, it should replace this stub
with the consolidated mapping and field definitions.
